                    Retrowave is a genre of music that mimics the musical style of synthwave (electronic music with synthesizers) that originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The music and its
                    aesthetic romanticizes nostalgia of movie- and video game soundtracks from the 1980s, especially genres like action, science fiction, horror and slasher movies. The aesthetic is
                    considered to be almost as important as the music itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Retrowave can be split into sub genres like outrun, vaporwave, dreamwave, retro electro, italo disco, darksynth, and others. Musically, all the genres use characteristics from the
                    1980s like straight 4/4 beats, exaggeratedly loud drum samples, and gated reverbs. And of course as the name of the genre implies, the main rhythm and melodies are created using
                    synthesizers. Synthwave isn’t necessarily instrumental, but a majority of the music is without vocals, with synths running the lead melodies. Many artists also “interpret” modern
                    music through retrowave, for example retrowave fused with heavy metal, like Carpenter Brut and Dance With the Dead.

                    <p>Kavinsky (Vincent Belorgey) is a French producer of outrun, who gained great mainstream recognition after "Nightcall" was featured in the 2011 movie "Drive". He grew up watching thousands of movies in the 80s which is his main inspiration for the music. Kavinsky is the alter ego created by Belorgey, who died in a car accident in 1986 and arose as a zombie, forever destined to drive down the streets in his Ferrari Testarossa.</p>
